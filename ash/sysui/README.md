This directory contains the non-window management aspects of ash as a
mojo application (mojo:ash_sysui). This directory is temporary as we
transition to getting all of ash running on top of mus as a single
mojo app. That work will happen in the directory ash/mus. Once ash/mus
is far enough along this directory will be nuked.
