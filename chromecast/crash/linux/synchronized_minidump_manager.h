// Abstract base class for mutually-exclusive minidump handling. Ensures
// synchronized access among instances of this class to the minidumps directory
// using a file lock. The "lockfile" also holds serialized metadata about each
// of the minidumps in the directory. Derived classes should not access the
// lockfile directly. Instead, use protected methods to query and modify the
// metadata, but only within the implementation of DoWork().
//
// This class holds an in memory representation of the lockfile and metadata
// file when the lockfile is held. Modifier methods work on this in memory
// representation. When the lockfile is released, the in memory representations
// are written to file
//
// The lockfile file is of the following format:
// { <dump_info1> }
// { <dump_info2> }
// ...
// { <dump_infoN> }
//
// Note that this isn't a valid json object. It is formatted in this way so
// that producers to this file do not need to understand json.
//
// Current external producers:
// + watchdog
//
//
// The metadata file is a separate file containing a json dictionary.
