// An interface through which a Mojo application may communicate with the Mojo
// system and request connections to other applications.
interface Shell {
  // Establishes a connection with another application (located at
  // |application_url|) through which the calling application and the other
  // application may request services from one another.
  //
  // If the calling application would like to request services from the other
  // application, it should pass a valid interface request in the |services|
  // parameter (i.e. one containing a valid message pipe endpoint). If the other
  // application does not wish to offer services, it may either not bind an
  // implementation to the interface request, or else bind an implementation
  // that will reject some or all service requests.
  //
  // If the calling application would like to offer services to the other
  // application, it should pass a bound interface through the
  // |exposed_services| parameter. The other application may then request
  // services through that interface.
  //
  // At least one of |services| or |exposed_services| should be valid/bound in
  // the call.
  //
  // If the |application_url| does not contain a domain, but is of the form
  // "mojo:{service}", it is up to the Mojo shell to select an appropriate
  // application for the service. Currently, the shell does this based on the
  // value of its --origin flag.
