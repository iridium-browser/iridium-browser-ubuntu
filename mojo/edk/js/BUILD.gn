# TODO(hansmuller): The organization of tests in this directory is weird:
#   * Really, js_unittests tests public stuff, so that should live in public
#     and be reworked as some sort of apptest.
#   * Both js_unittests and js_integration_tests should auto-generate their
#     tests somehow. The .cc files are just test runner stubs, including
#     explicit lists of .js files.
