Hello Service
=============

This is a simple service which asks for a name in the request and
responds with a hello.

Google App Engine
=================

For more information about Google App Engine, and to download the SDK, see:

Running locally
===============

ProtoRPC is packaged with the App Engine SDK, but the version shipped
may not be the most current version due to the App Engine release
schedule. If you'd like to use the most current version of ProtoRPC,
you can install it in the hello/server directory.

For example on a unix-like OS, you could either copy:

  $ cp -r $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/hello/server

or symlink the directory:

  $ ln -s $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/hello/server/protorpc

To run this demo locally, you need to run an instance of the Google App
Engine dev-appserver.  The server defaults on port 8080.

Example on a unix-like OS:

  $ python $GAE_SDK/dev_appserver.py $PROTORPC/demos/hello/server
