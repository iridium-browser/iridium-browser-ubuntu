Echo Service
============

The echo service is a service that echos a request back to the caller.  Useful
for testing and illustrates all data types in the forms interface.

Google App Engine
=================

For more information about Google App Engine, and to download the SDK, see:

Running locally
===============

ProtoRPC is packaged with the App Engine SDK, but the version shipped
may not be the most current version due to the App Engine release
schedule. If you'd like to use the most current version of ProtoRPC,
you can install it in the echo directory.

For example on a unix-like OS, you could either copy:

  $ cp -r $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/echo

or symlink the directory:

  $ ln -s $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/echo/protorpc

To run this demo locally, you need to run an instance of the Google App
Engine dev-appserver.  The server defaults on port 8080.

Example on a unix-like OS:

  $ python $GAE_SDK/dev_appserver.py $PROTORPC/demos/echo
