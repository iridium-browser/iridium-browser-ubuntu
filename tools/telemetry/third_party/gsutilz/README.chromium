Description:
gsutil is a Python application that allow access Google Cloud Storage from
the command line. gsutil can do a wide range of bucket and object
management tasks, including:
* Creating and deleting buckets.
* Uploading, downloading, and deleting objects.
* Listing buckets and objects.
* Moving, copying, and renaming objects.
* Editing object and bucket ACLs.

Local Modifications:
_ Flip executable bits of file with shebang to pass the checkperm script.
_ Temporarily remove gsutilz/third_party/ to avoid overloading build bots.
_ Temporarily rename top level naming from gsutil to gsutilz so patch can apply
cleanly on the buildbots.
