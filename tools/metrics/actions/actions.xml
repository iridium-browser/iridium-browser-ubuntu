<!--
This file is a comprehensive list of Chrome user actions along with the owner
and description for each user action. A user action should be tied to an actual
action taken by a user. It should be logged immediatly after a user takes the
action, and should only be logged once per actual event. If an action is not
user triggered, specify it using not_user_triggered="true" as an attribute to
the <action> tag.

Please run extract_actions.py to add new actions and pretty-print this file.

If a user action is not being used any more, put an <obsolete> tag under
the <action> tag with necessary explanation. Don't delete things in this file.

TODO(yiyaoliu):
Currently, only file-level comments are supported. By running
extract_actions.py, comments at other places will be deleted. Ideally, comments
should be able to be added at any place in this file.
