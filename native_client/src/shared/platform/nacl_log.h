/*
 * NaCl logging module.
 *
 * This module is used in many parts of Native Client to generate
 * logging output.
 *
 * If you want logging output to show up, generally you would
 *
 * (1) include the lines
 *
 * #define NACL_LOG_MODULE_NAME "my_module"
 * #include "native_client/src/trusted/platform/nacl_log.h"
 *
 * in your files from which you want to generate logging output.  If
 * the NACL_LOG_MODULE_NAME preprocessor symbol is not defined, then a
 * global verbosity level is used for the logging statements' outputs.
 * NB: the definition of NACL_LOG_MODULE_NAME *must* precede the
 * include.
 *
 * Then
 *
 * (2) include actual logging output lines such as
 *
 * NaClLog(3, "Hello %s\n", "world");
 *
 * The 3 is a "detail level" for this particular log message, the
 * "Hello %s\n" is the familiar printf-style format string, and all
 * subsequent arguments are the corresponding arguments.  Type
 * checking for these arguments are done when gcc-compatible compilers
 * are used.
 *
 * When running the program (assuming the main function invoked the
 * module initializer(s) appropriately [see NaClLogModuleInit*
 * below]), you can set the verbosity level for each module, as well
 * as the global verbosity level (source files for which
 * NACL_LOG_MODULE_NAME was not defined) by running the program with
 * the NACLVERBOSITY environment variable, viz:
 *
 *   NACLVERBOSITY=3:elf_util=4:my_module=5
 *
 * would set the default verbosity level to be 3, the verbosity level
 * for the elf_util module to be 4, and the verbosity level for the
 * my_module module to be 5.
 *
 * NB: because of craziness in the test infrastructure, we accept
 * either ',' or ':' as separators.  (Setting osenv in the SCons
 * python code with NACLVERBOSITY=3,elf_util=4 would set two
 * environment variables "NACLVERBOSITY" and "elf_util", despite the
 * fact that osenv is a list of name=value strings.)
 *
 * In this case, when the desired verbosity level for my_module is 5,
 * all logging output at detail level 5 and below would be printed to
 * the log output, and logging statements with a higher detail level
 * would be suppressed.
 *
 * Pre-defined logging detail levels of LOG_INFO, LOG_WARNING,
 * LOG_ERROR, and LOG_FATAL may also be used.  When LOG_FATAL is used,
 * the application aborts after the log message is generated.
 * Messages at these levels cannot be suppressed.
 *
 *
 * The default logging output is standard error.  NB: on Windows, both
 * stdout and stderr are discarded for Windowed applications.
 *
 * All logging output may be redirected to a file using the NACLLOG
 * environment variable, the value of which should be the path to a
 * file.  NOTE: when running in Chrome, the outer sandbox is by
 * default enabled, so the log module will be unable to open the log
 * file.  In order to enable this for testing, use the --no-sandbox
 * flag to Chrome.  (This is not recommended for normal use, since it
 * eliminates a layer of defense.)
