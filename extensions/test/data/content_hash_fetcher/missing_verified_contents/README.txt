The files in this directory came from downloading a test extension from the
webstore* that had properly signed verified_contents.json file, taking the
regular extension files (manifest and content script) from the .crx and putting
them into a source.zip file, and pulling out the
_metadata/verified_contents.json file to be standalone in this directory.
