// MultiThreadedProxyResolver is a ProxyResolver implementation that runs
// synchronous ProxyResolver implementations on worker threads.
//
// Threads are created lazily on demand, up to a maximum total. The advantage
// of having a pool of threads, is faster performance. In particular, being
// able to keep servicing PAC requests even if one blocks its execution.
//
// During initialization (SetPacScript), a single thread is spun up to test
// the script. If this succeeds, we cache the input script, and will re-use
// this to lazily provision any new threads as needed.
//
// For each new thread that we spawn, a corresponding new ProxyResolver is
// created using ProxyResolverFactory.
//
// Because we are creating multiple ProxyResolver instances, this means we
// are duplicating script contexts for what is ordinarily seen as being a
// single script. This can affect compatibility on some classes of PAC
// script:
//
// (a) Scripts whose initialization has external dependencies on network or
//     time may end up successfully initializing on some threads, but not
//     others. So depending on what thread services the request, the result
//     may jump between several possibilities.
//
// (b) Scripts whose FindProxyForURL() depends on side-effects may now
//     work differently. For example, a PAC script which was incrementing
//     a global counter and using that to make a decision. In the
//     multi-threaded model, each thread may have a different value for this
//     counter, so it won't globally be seen as monotonically increasing!
