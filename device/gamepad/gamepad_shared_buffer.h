 GamepadHardwareBuffer is stored in shared memory that's shared between the
 browser which does the hardware polling, and the various consumers of the
 gamepad state (renderers and NaCl plugins). The performance characteristics are
 that we want low latency (so would like to avoid explicit communication via IPC
 between producer and consumer) and relatively large data size.

 Writer and reader operate on the same buffer assuming contention is low, and
 contention is detected by using the associated SeqLock.
