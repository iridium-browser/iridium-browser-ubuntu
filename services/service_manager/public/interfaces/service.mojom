  //  identity
  //    The identity of this instance in the service manager. Includes:
  //    * The resolved name used in the connection request that resulted in this
  //      instance being initialized.
  //    * The user associated with this instance in the service manager. This
  //      will never be kInheritUserID.

  //
  // Response parameters:
  //
  //  connector_request
  //    An optional Connector request for the service manager to bind, allowing
  //    the initialized client to connect to others.
  //
  //  control_request
  //    An optional associated ServiceControl request.

  // Called when another service attempts to open a connection to this
  // service. A service implements this method to complete the exchange
  // of interface implementations with the remote service. See also
  // documentation in service_manager.mojom for Connect(). The service
  // originating the request is referred to as the "source" and the one
  // receiving the "target".
  //
  // The Service must respond to acknowledge receipt of the request.
  //
  // Parameters:
  //
  //  source_info
  //    Contains the source identity and interface provider specs.
  //
  //  interfaces
  //    A request for an InterfaceProvider by which the source service may
  //    seek to bind interface implementations exported by the target.
  //
  OnConnect(ServiceInfo source_info, InterfaceProvider&? interfaces) => ();

  // Called when a request to bind an interface is received from another
  // ("source") service. This is the result of that service calling
  // BindInterface() on a Connector. By the time this method is called, the
  // service manager has already completed a policy check to determine that this
  // interface can be bound.
  //
  // The Service must respond to acknowledge receipt of the request.
  //
  // Parameters:
  //
  //  source_info
  //    Contains the source identity and interface provider specs.
  //
  //  interface_name
  //    The name of the interface to be bound.
  //
  //  interface_pipe
  //    The message pipe to bind the interface implementation to.
  //
  // TODO(beng): It occurs to me that |source_info| leaks all metadata about
  //             the source's capability requirements to the target. This seems
  //             undesirable. The metadata supplied here should be germane to
  //             fulfilling this request and no more.
  // TODO(beng): This should replace OnConnect().
