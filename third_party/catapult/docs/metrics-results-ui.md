# Metrics Results UI

This document assumes familiarity with the concepts introduced in
[how-to-write-metrics](/docs/how-to-write-metrics.md).

Metrics produce Histograms, which are serialized into an HTML file named
`results.html` by default. Upon opening this HTML file in Chrome, after all of
the Histograms are loaded, the `histogram-set-table` processes them and displays
many names, numbers, and controls.

This complex UI can be overwhelming initially, but understanding how to use it
can pay off in deep performance insights.

## The Table

We'll skip the top two rows of controls for now because they modify what
information is displayed in the table, which we need to understand first.

### The Name Column

The first column always contains Names. Usually, these are Histogram names,
which are the strings that metrics pass to Histogram constructors. However, as
we'll see in "The Groupby-picker", if you group by attributes of Histograms
besides their name, like the "story name", then this first Name column will
contain the name of the grouping of Histograms, such as the story name.

![The first, left-most column is the Name column.
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-name.png)

### The Value Column(s)

The other columns contain Histogram values.
One of the other attributes of Histograms is their `displayLabel`. If these
Histograms were produced by Telemetry, then you can pass `--results-label` to
Telemetry's `run_benchmark` command to set a label for all of the Histograms
produced by that benchmark run. Otherwise, displayLabel will default to the
benchmark name plus the time that the benchmark was run.
There is a separate value column for each distinct displayLabel value, which is
displayed in the header cell.

![The other columns contain values splayed by label.

### Grouping Tree

Histograms can be grouped into a tree configured by the groupby-picker,
described below.
Non-leaf node Histograms are merged from the Histograms that are grouped under
them.
Histograms that are grouped together are only mergeable if they share the same
units and bin boundaries.

![Rows are grouped and nested to form a tree.
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-grouping.png)

If a non-leaf node Histogram is merged from unmergeable Histograms, then the
table will display that non-leaf node Histogram as the string "(unmergeable)".

![Attempts to merge unmergeable Histograms display "(unmergeable)".
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-unmergeable.png)

### Sorting

Click the up/down pointing triangles in the table header row in order to sort
the table by that column.
Sorting the Name column sorts alphabetically.
Sorting Value columns sorts numerically by Histogram average.

![Columns are sortable.
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-sorting.png)

### The Overview Line Charts

Click a blue line chart icon in the Name column to display the overview line
charts in that row. These line charts graph Histogram averages. The x-axes of
these charts differ:

#### Overview Line Charts in the Name Column

The x-axis of the overview line chart in the Name column corresponds to the
value columns.

![Overview line chart comparing columns.
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-name-overview.png)

#### Overview Line Charts in Value Columns

The x-axis of the overview line chart in the Value columns correspond to the
Histograms in the Grouping Tree that were merged to produce the Histogram in
that table cell.

![Overview line chart comparing subrows.
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-value-overview.png)

### The Show Histogram Button

By default, table cells contain only averages of the Histograms in those cells.

Click the bar chart icon in table cells to display more information about the
Histogram:
 * Histogram bin count bar chart (if the Histogram has only a single bin, then
   it will be a box chart),
 * summary statistics as configured by the metric,
 * Diagnostics

Click and drag the mouse around the bar chart in order to display sample
diagnostics for the selected Histogram bins.

![Show full Histogram data for a cell.

## The Groupby-picker

The `groupby-picker` sits just above the table and allows you to control how
Histograms are grouped into the Grouping Tree.

Grouping keys include
 * Histogram name
 * Benchmark name
 * Story name
 * Storyset repetition
 * Story repetition
 * Legacy TIR label for TBMv1 benchmarks
 * Story grouping keys

You can enable or disable grouping keys by clicking the checkboxes, and re-order
them by clicking the left and right arrows.

## The Top Controls

Finally, the row of controls at the top of the screen contains several different
small control elements. Let's start at the left.

### The Search box

Type a string in the Search box to filter Histograms out of the displayed
HistogramSet whose name, shortName, and description do not contain the search
query.

For example, the v8 metric produces Histograms whose names end with either
"duration" or "count". The "duration" Histograms cannot be merged with the
"count" histograms. If you group by any other grouping key besides "name" first,
then the table will try to merge some "count" Histograms with some "duration"
Histograms. The two different kinds of Histograms have different units, so they
cannot be merged, so the table will display "(unmergeable)". In order to make
the table ignore the "count" Histograms so that it can merge all of the
"duration" Histograms together, you can filter out the "count" Histograms by
entering "duration" in the Search box.

![Filter Histograms by searching.
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-search.png)

### The Total Overview Chart Button

Toggle the Overview Line Charts for all visible rows at once by clicking the
blue line chart button to the right of the Search box.

![Show overview line charts for all visible rows.
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-total-overview.png)

### The Reference Column Selector

The Reference Column Selector is displayed when there are multiple Value columns
in order to allow you to select one. When one Value column is selected as a
reference, then all of the other Value columns will update to display the delta
between that column and the reference Value column.

For example, if there are two Value columns "A" and "B", and you select "A" in
the Reference Column Selector, then the values displayed in the "A" Value column
will remain the same, but the values displayed in the "B" Value column will
change to display the differences between the values in the "B" column and the
corresponding values in the "A" column.

When you open a histogram in a non-reference Value column, in addition to the
statistics produced by the Histogram such as "avg", "stddev", "min", "max", etc.
the Histogram statistic table will also display statistics about the delta
between that Histogram and the corresponding reference Histogram. Delta
statistics include
 * abs&#916;avg: absolute delta between Histogram averages,
 * %&#916;avg: percent delta average,
 * z-score: (aka standard score) the number of standard deviations between the
   Histogram average and the reference Histogram average,
 * p-value: the probability that the Histograms are NOT significantly different,
 * U-statistic: a number produced and consumed by the [Mann-Whitney U hypothesis
   test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test)

To the right of the table of statistics, an emoji (smiley) face will be
displayed:
 * a green grinning face when the current Histogram is statistically
   significantly better than the reference column, or
 * a red frowning face when the current Histogram is statistically significantly
   worse than the reference column, or
 * a neutral face when the current Histogram is not statistically significantly
   different from the reference column.

![Select a reference column.
](/docs/images/metrics-results-ui-reference-column.png)

### The Download CSV Button

Clicking this button downloads a CSV file that can be imported into a
spreadsheet app such as Google Sheets.

After the header row, there will be one row for each of the leaf Histograms in
the Grouping Tree. For example, if you group only by Histogram name, then there
will be as many value rows as there are distinct Histogram names in the
displayed HistogramSet.

The columns will contain
 * Histogram name and units
 * summary statistics as configured by the metrics that produced the Histograms
   (avg, stddev, min, max, etc.),
 * TelemetryInfo fields (benchmarkName, storyName, etc.).

![Download leaf Histograms as CSV.

### The Show All Checkbox

By default, this checkbox is unchecked so that the table only displays
Histograms that are source nodes in the metric graphical model.
Check this checkbox in order to show all Histograms, including those that are
not source nodes in the metric graphical model.
