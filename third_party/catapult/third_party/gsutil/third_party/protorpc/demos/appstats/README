Appstats Service
================

This utility can be integrated in to an existing application that uses
appstats to turn appstats in to a service that can be remotely
queried.

Google App Engine
=================

For more information about Google App Engine, and to download the SDK, see:

Appstats
========

For more information about appstats, please see:

  http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/appstats.html

The file appstats.descriptor is a binary FileSet descriptor encoded in
protocol buffer format as defined in protorpc.descriptor.FileSet.  The
defintions were described from yet to be published .proto file.  The
generated classes are the same as defined in:

  google.appengine.ext.appstats.datamodel_pb.py

Running locally
===============

ProtoRPC is packaged with the App Engine SDK, but the version shipped
may not be the most current version due to the App Engine release
schedule. If you'd like to use the most current version of ProtoRPC,
you can install it in the appstats directory.

For example on a unix-like OS, you could either copy:

  $ cp -r $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/appstats

or symlink the directory:

  $ ln -s $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/appstats/protorpc

To run this demo locally, you need to run an instance of the Google App
Engine dev-appserver.  The server defaults on port 8080.

Example on a unix-like OS:

  $ python $GAE_SDK/dev_appserver.py $PROTORPC/demos/appstats
