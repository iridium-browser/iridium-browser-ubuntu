Quota Service
=============

It is possible to set up a quota service in your own application by following
these steps:

  1) Make a copy of the contents of this directory, including subdirectories
      for use as a custom backend of any client application that will use it.

  2) Modify app.yaml:
      a. Change the application to the name of your application.
      b. Change the version to one that is appropriate for your application.

  3) Edit quotas.js so that its settings are appropriate for your application.
      The format of the quotas.js file is a JSON encoded ProtoRPC message
      as defined by quotas.service.QuotaConfig of this demo.
