Guestbook Service
=================

This sample contains two sample ProtoRPC services that allow users to
sign a guestbook. The two applications act as client and server.

Google App Engine
=================

For more information about Google App Engine, and to download the SDK, see:

Running locally
===============

ProtoRPC is packaged with the App Engine SDK, but the version shipped
may not be the most current version due to the App Engine release
schedule. If you'd like to use the most current version of ProtoRPC,
you can install it in the guestbook/client and guestbook/server
directories.

For example on a unix-like OS, you could either copy:

  $ cp -r $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/guestbook/client
  $ cp -r $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/guestbook/server

or symlink the directory:

  $ ln -s $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/guestbook/client/protorpc
  $ ln -s $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/guestbook/server/protorpc

To run this demo locally, you need to run an instance of the Google App
Engine dev-appserver both for the client and the server. The dev-appserver
defaults on port 8080, so use different ports to avoid a port collision.

Example on a unix-like OS:

  $ python $GAE_SDK/dev_appserver.py --port=8080 $PROTORPC/demos/guestbook/client &
  $ python $GAE_SDK/dev_appserver.py --port=8081 $PROTORPC/demos/guestbook/server
