Local Modifications:
_ Added this file.
_ Edited third_party/oauth2client/oauth2client/contrib/multistore_file.py
  to have non-zero timeout to workaround a broken lock file issue. This
  is already fixed upstream, but they haven't done a new release version
  yet. This local modification can be removed as soon as this library is
  updated past 4.28.
