Custom web components and tests
========

This directory contains Polymer elements and their unit tests.

How to run single tests
--------

1. Start a local HTTP server, e.g. using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081`.
   Other local HTTP servers also work, for example http-server which can
   be installed with `npm install -g http-server`.
2. Navigate to one of the individual test HTML files.

How to run all tests
--------

Not implemented yet; in the future,  this should be done similarly to
[the trace-viewer project](https://github.com/google/trace-viewer).
