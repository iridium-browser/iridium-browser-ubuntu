"""Mapper functions for mapreduce jobs.

Jobs can also be started through the /mapreduce endpoint. Configuration
for jobs started through that endpoint is set in mapreduce.yaml.

See:
  https://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/wiki/GettingStartedInPython

Note about running mapreduce jobs that write to the datastore while datastore
writes are disabled: There is a parameter 'force_ops_writes' for mapreduce jobs
that is supposed to force writes. Another way of forcing writes for a one-off
job is to deploy a version of the app with the force writes option always set to
True the mapreduce code (see mapreduce/util.py line 334).
