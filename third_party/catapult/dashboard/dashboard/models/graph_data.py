"""The datastore models for graph data.

The Chromium project uses Buildbot to run its performance tests, and the
structure of the data for the Performance Dashboard reflects this. Metadata
about tests are structured in a hierarchy of Master, Bot, and Test entities.
Master and Bot entities represent Buildbot masters and builders respectively,
and Test entities represent groups of results, or individual data series.

For example, entities might be structured as follows:

  Master: ChromiumPerf
    Bot: win7
      Test: page_cycler.moz
        Test: times
          Test: page_load_time
          Test: page_load_time_ref
          Test: www.amazon.com
          Test: www.bing.com
        Test: commit_charge
          Test: ref
          Test: www.amazon.com
          Test: www.bing.com

The graph data points are represented by Row entities. Each Row entity contains
a revision and value, which are its X and Y values on a graph, and any other
metadata associated with an individual performance test result.

The keys of the Row entities for a particular data series are start with a
TestContainer key, instead of a Test key. This way, the Row entities for each
data series are in a different "entity group". This allows a faster rate of
putting data in the datastore for many series at once.

For example, Row entities are organized like this:

  TestContainer: ChromiumPerf/win7/page_cycler.moz/times/page_load_time
    Row: revision 12345, value 2.5
    Row: revision 12346, value 2.0
    Row: revision 12347, value 2.1
  TestContainer: ChromiumPerf/win7/page_cycler.moz/times/page_load_time_ref
    Row: revision 12345, value 2.4
    Row: revision 12346, value 2.0
    Row: revision 12347, value 2.2
  TestContainer: ChromiumPerf/win7/page_cycler.moz/commit_charge
    Row: revision 12345, value 10
    Row: revision 12346, value 12
    Row: revision 12347, value 11


IMPORTANT: If you add new kinds to this file, you must also add them to the
Daily Backup url in cron.yaml in order for them to be properly backed up.
