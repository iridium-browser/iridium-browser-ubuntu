Description:
Dpkg is a package manager for Debian.  The component necessary for
development is dpkg-shlibdeps which calculates dependency information
for executables.

This should only be added during the infra transition from Precise to
Trusty, and should be removed once complete.  See bug 655755 for
details.

How to update:
1. Acquire the dpkg-dev source: "apt-get source dpkg-dev".
2. Remove all but *table and scripts/ from the top-level dirctory.
3. Remove all but "Dpkg", "Dpkg.pm", and "dpkg-shlibdeps.pl" from scripts/

Local Modifications: Removed all unnecessary utilities.
