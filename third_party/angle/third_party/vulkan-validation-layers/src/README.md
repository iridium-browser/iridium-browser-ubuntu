## Introduction

Vulkan is an Explicit API, enabling direct control over how GPUs actually work. By design, minimal error checking is done inside
a Vulkan driver. Applications have full control and responsibility for correct operation. Any errors in
how Vulkan is used can result in a crash. This project provides Vulkan validation layers that can be enabled
to assist development by enabling developers to verify their applications correct use of the Vulkan API.

Vulkan supports multiple GPUs and multiple global contexts (VkInstance). The ICD loader is necessary to
support multiple GPUs and VkInstance-level Vulkan commands.  Additionally, the loader manages inserting
Vulkan layer libraries such as validation layers between the application and the ICD.

The following components are available in this repository:
- [Vulkan header files](include/vulkan/)
- [*ICD Loader*](loader/)
- [*Validation Layers*](layers/)
- [*Mock ICD*](icd/)
- [*Demos*](demos/)
- [*Tests*](tests/)
