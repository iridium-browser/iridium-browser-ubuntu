/**
 * @group Iron Elements
 *
 * The `iron-iconset-svg` element allows users to define their own icon sets
 * that contain svg icons. The svg icon elements should be children of the
 * `iron-iconset-svg` element. Multiple icons should be given distinct id's.
 *
 * Using svg elements to create icons has a few advantages over traditional
 * bitmap graphics like jpg or png. Icons that use svg are vector based so they
 * are resolution independent and should look good on any device. They are
 * stylable via css. Icons can be themed, colorized, and even animated.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     <iron-iconset-svg id="my-svg-icons" iconSize="24">
 *       <svg>
 *         <defs>
 *           <g id="shape">
 *             <rect x="50" y="50" width="50" height="50" />
 *             <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" />
 *           </g>
 *         </defs>
 *       </svg>
 *     </iron-iconset-svg>
 *
 * This will automatically register the icon set "my-svg-icons" to the iconset
 * database.  To use these icons from within another element, make a
 * `iron-iconset` element and call the `byId` method
 * to retrieve a given iconset. To apply a particular icon inside an
 * element use the `applyIcon` method. For example:
 *
 *     iconset.applyIcon(iconNode, 'car');
 *
 * @element iron-iconset-svg
