**THIS ELEMENT IS EXPERIMENTAL.  API AND NAME SUBJECT TO CHANGE.**

The `x-repeat` element is a custom `HTMLTemplateElement` type extension that
automatically stamps and binds one instance of template content to each object
in a user-provided array.  `x-repeat` accepts an `items` property, and one
instance of the template is stamped for each item into the DOM at the location
of the `x-repeat` element.  The `item` property will be set on each instance's
binding scope, thus templates should bind to sub-properties of `item`.

Example:

```html
<dom-module id="employee-list">

  <template>

    <div> Employee list: </div>
    <template is="x-repeat" items="{{employees}}">
        <div>First name: <span>{{item.first}}</span></div>
        <div>Last name: <span>{{item.last}}</span></div>
    </template>

  </template>

  <script>
    Polymer({
      is: 'employee-list',
      ready: function() {
        this.employees = [
            {first: 'Bob', last: 'Smith'},
            {first: 'Sally', last: 'Johnson'},
            ...
        ];
      }
    });
  </script>

</dom-module>
```

Notifications for changes to items sub-properties will be forwarded to template
instances, which will update via the normal structured data notification system.

Mutations to the `items` array itself (`push`, `pop`, `splice`, `shift`,
`unshift`) are observed via `Array.observe` (where supported, or an
shim of this API on unsupported browsers), and template instances are kept in
sync with the data in the array.

A view-specific filter/sort may be applied to each `x-repeat` by supplying a
`filter` and/or `sort` property.  This may be a string that names a function on
the host, or a function may be assigned to the property directly.  The functions
should implemented following the standard `Array` filter/sort API.

In order to re-run the filter or sort functions based on changes to sub-fields
of `items`, the `observe` property may be set as a space-separated list of
`item` sub-fields that should cause a re-filter/sort when modified.

For example, for an `x-repeat` with a filter of the following:

```js
isEngineer: function(item) {
    return item.type == 'engineer' || item.manager.type == 'engineer';
}
```

Then the `observe` property should be configured as follows:

```html
<template is="x-repeat" items="{{employees}}"
          filter="isEngineer" observe="type manager.type">
```
