Polymer is comprised of two efforts:
1. A set of core platform features (Shadow DOM, Custom Elements, MDV).
Initially, these core features will be enabled with a set of polyfills. As
browsers begin to implement these new primitives, the polyfill platform layer
becomes smaller and better over time.
2. A next-generation web application framework built upon these core
technologies called the Polymer.

Local Modifications:
- Removed executable bit from the files in 'components/iron-selector'.
- Created a copy 'components-chromium' of the 'components' directory with the
only difference that all inline JavaScript blocks are extracted from Polymer
HTML elements to external JS files. This version of the Polymer is used in a web
UI, where CSP forbids an execution of inline scripts. The extraction was made
with the help of the Vulcanize tool (https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize).
- Replaced CRLF line endings with LF line endings in text files.

To restore a content of the 'components', 'components-chromium' directorires
from scratch, run ./reproduce.sh (requires bower and vulcanize >= 1.2).

Note on Bower:
The directory can be updated by running "bower update". A new component can be
installed by running "bower install -S Polymer/<component>#version". Be sure to
add the .bower.json file to the repository as it includes the revision
information of the polymer component.
Also be sure that you listed all the added packages and **all their
dependencies** in bower.json, and specified **exact** versions of every package
explicitly. That is needed because Bower can't handle recursive dependencies
correctly (see http://stackoverflow.com/q/25899532).
