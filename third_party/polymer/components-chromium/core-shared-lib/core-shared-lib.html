Supports sharing a JSONP-based JavaScript library.

    <core-shared-lib on-core-shared-lib-load="{{load}}" url="https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js?onload=%%callback%%">

Multiple components can request a library using a `core-shared-lib` component and only one copy of that library will
loaded from the network.

Currently, the library must support JSONP to work as a shared-lib. 

Some libraries require a specific global function be defined. If this is the case, specify the `callbackName` property.

Where possible, you should use an HTML Import to load library dependencies. Rather than using this element,
create an import (`<link rel="import" href="lib.html">`) that wraps loading the .js file:

lib.html:

    <script src="lib.js"></script>

@group Polymer Core Elements
@element core-shared-lib

</head><body><polymer-element name="core-shared-lib" attributes="url notifyEvent callbackName" assetpath="">

</polymer-element>
<script charset="utf-8" src="core-shared-lib-extracted.js"></script></body></html>
