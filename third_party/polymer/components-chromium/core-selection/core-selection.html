@group Polymer Core Elements

The `<core-selection>` element is used to manage selection state. It has no
visual appearance and is typically used in conjunction with another element.
For example, [core-selector](#core-selector)
uses a `<core-selection>` to manage selection.

To mark an item as selected, call the `select(item)` method on 
`<core-selection>`. The item itself is an argument to this method.

The `<core-selection>`element manages selection state for any given set of
items. When an item is selected, the `core-select` event is fired.

The attribute `multi` indicates if multiple items can be selected at once.
  
Example:
 
    <polymer-element name="selection-example">
       <template>
         <style>
           polyfill-next-selector { content: ':host > .selected'; }
           ::content > .selected {
             font-weight: bold;
             font-style: italic;
           }
         </style>
         <ul on-tap="{{itemTapAction}}">
           <content></content>
         </ul>
         <core-selection id="selection" multi
                         on-core-select="{{selectAction}}"></core-selection>
       </template>
       <script>
         Polymer('selection-example', {
           itemTapAction: function(e, detail, sender) {
             this.$.selection.select(e.target);
           },
           selectAction: function(e, detail, sender) {
             detail.item.classList.toggle('selected', detail.isSelected);
           }
         });
       </script>
    </polymer-element>

    <selection-example>
      <li>Red</li>
      <li>Green</li>
      <li>Blue</li>
    </selection-example>
