The `core-overlay` element displays overlayed on top of other content. It starts
out hidden and is displayed by setting its `opened` property to true.
A `core-overlay's` opened state can be toggled by calling the `toggle`
method.

The `core-overlay` will, by default, show/hide itself when it's opened. The 
`target` property may be set to another element to cause that element to 
be shown when the overlay is opened.

It's common to want a `core-overlay` to animate to its opened
position. The `core-overlay` element uses a `core-transition` to handle
animation. The default transition is `core-transition-fade` which 
causes the overlay to fade in when displayed. See 
<a href="../core-transition/">`core-transition`</a> for more
information about customizing a `core-overlay's` opening animation. The
`backdrop` property can be set to true to show a backdrop behind the overlay
that will darken the rest of the window.

An element that should close the `core-overlay` will automatically
do so if it's given the `core-overlay-toggle` attribute. This attribute
can be customized with the `closeAttribute` property. You can also use
`closeSelector` if more general matching is needed.

By default  `core-overlay` will close whenever the user taps outside it or
presses the escape key. This behavior can be turned off via the
`autoCloseDisabled` property.

    <core-overlay>
      <h2>Dialog</h2>
      <input placeholder="say something..." autofocus>
      <div>I agree with this wholeheartedly.</div>
      <button core-overlay-toggle>OK</button>
    </core-overlay>

`core-overlay` will automatically size and position itself according to the 
following rules. The overlay's size is constrained such that it does not
overflow the screen. This is done by setting maxHeight/maxWidth on the 
`sizingTarget`. If the `sizingTarget` already has a setting for one of these
properties, it will not be overridden. The overlay should
be positioned via css or imperatively using the `core-overlay-position` event.
If the overlay is not positioned vertically via setting `top` or `bottom`, it
will be centered vertically. The same is true horizontally via a setting to 
`left` or `right`. In addition, css `margin` can be used to provide some space
around the overlay. This can be used to ensure
that, for example, a drop shadow is always visible around the overlay.

Fired when the `core-overlay` needs to position itself. Optionally, implement
in order to position an overlay via code. If the overlay was not otherwise
positioned, it's important to indicate how the overlay has been positioned by
setting the `dimensions.position` object. For example, if the overlay has been
positioned via setting `right` and `top`, set dimensions.position to an
object like this: `{v: 'top', h: 'right'}`.
