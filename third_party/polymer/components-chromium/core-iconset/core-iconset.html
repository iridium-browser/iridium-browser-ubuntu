/**
 * @group Polymer Core Elements
 *
 * The `core-iconset` element allows users to define their own icon sets. 
 * The `src` property specifies the url of the icon image. Multiple icons may
 * be included in this image and they may be organized into rows.
 * The `icons` property is a space separated list of names corresponding to the
 * icons. The names must be ordered as the icons are ordered in the icon image.
 * Icons are expected to be square and are the size specified by the `iconSize`
 * property. The `width` property corresponds to the width of the icon image 
 * and must be specified if icons are arranged into multiple rows in the image.
 *
 * All `core-iconset` elements are available for use by other `core-iconset`
 * elements via a database keyed by id. Typically, an element author that wants
 * to support a set of custom icons uses a `core-iconset` to retrieve 
 * and use another, user-defined iconset.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     <core-iconset id="my-icons" src="my-icons.png" width="96" iconSize="24"
 *         icons="location place starta stopb bus car train walk">
 *     </core-iconset>
 *
 * This will automatically register the icon set "my-icons" to the iconset
 * database.  To use these icons from within another element, make a 
 * `core-iconset` element and call the `byId` method to retrieve a
 * given iconset. To apply a particular icon to an element, use the 
 * `applyIcon` method. For example:
 *
 *     iconset.applyIcon(iconNode, 'car');
 *
 * Themed icon sets are also supported. The `core-iconset` can contain child
 * `property` elements that specify a theme with an offsetX and offsetY of the
 * theme within the icon resource. For example.
 *
 *     <core-iconset id="my-icons" src="my-icons.png" width="96" iconSize="24"
 *         icons="location place starta stopb bus car train walk">
 *       <property theme="special" offsetX="256" offsetY="24"></property>
 *     </core-iconset>
 *
 * Then a themed icon can be applied like this:
 *
 *     iconset.applyIcon(iconNode, 'car', 'special');
 *
 * @element core-iconset
 * @extends core-meta
 * @homepage github.io
