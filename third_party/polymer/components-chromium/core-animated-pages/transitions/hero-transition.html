`hero-transition` transforms two elements in different pages such that they appear
to be shared across the pages.

Example:

    <core-animated-pages transition="hero-transition">
      <section layout horizontal>
        <div id="div1" flex></div>
        <div id="div2" flex hero-id="shared" hero></div>
      </section>
      <section>
      <section layout horizontal>
        <div id="div3" flex hero-id="shared" hero></div>
        <div id="div4" flex></div>
      </section>
      </section>
    </core-animated-pages>

In the above example, the elements `#div2` and `#div3` shares the same `hero-id`
attribute and a single element appears to translate and scale smoothly between
the two positions during a page transition.

Both elements from the source and destination pages must share the same `hero-id`
and must both contain the `hero` attribute to trigger the transition. The separate
`hero` attribute allows you to use binding to configure the transition:

Example:

    <core-animated-pages transition="hero-transition">
      <section layout horizontal>
        <div id="div1" flex hero-id="shared" hero?="{{selected == 0}}"></div>
        <div id="div2" flex hero-id="shared" hero?="{{selected == 1}}"></div>
      </section>
      <section>
      <section layout horizontal>
        <div id="div3" flex hero-id="shared" hero></div>
      </section>
      </section>
    </core-animated-pages>

In the above example, either `#div1` or `#div2` scales to `#div3` during a page transition,
depending on the value of `selected`.

Because it is common to share elements with different `border-radius` values, by default
this transition will also animate the `border-radius` property.

You can configure the duration of the hero transition with the global variable
`CoreStyle.g.transitions.heroDuration`.
