`app-route` is an element that enables declarative, self-describing routing
for a web app.

> *n.b. app-route is still in beta. We expect it will need some changes. We're counting on your feedback!*

In its typical usage, a `app-route` element consumes an object that describes
some state about the current route, via the `route` property. It then parses
that state using the `pattern` property, and produces two artifacts: some `data`
related to the `route`, and a `tail` that contains the rest of the `route` that
did not match.

Here is a basic example, when used with `app-location`:

    <app-location route="{{route}}"></app-location>
    <app-route
        route="{{route}}"
        pattern="/:page"
        data="{{data}}"
        tail="{{tail}}">
    </app-route>

In the above example, the `app-location` produces a `route` value. Then, the
`route.path` property is matched by comparing it to the `pattern` property. If
the `pattern` property matches `route.path`, the `app-route` will set or update
its `data` property with an object whose properties correspond to the parameters
in `pattern`. So, in the above example, if `route.path` was `'/about'`, the value
of `data` would be `{"page": "about"}`.

The `tail` property represents the remaining part of the route state after the
`pattern` has been applied to a matching `route`.

Here is another example, where `tail` is used:

    <app-location route="{{route}}"></app-location>
    <app-route
        route="{{route}}"
        pattern="/:page"
        data="{{routeData}}"
        tail="{{subroute}}">
    </app-route>
    <app-route
        route="{{subroute}}"
        pattern="/:id"
        data="{{subrouteData}}">
    </app-route>

In the above example, there are two `app-route` elements. The first
`app-route` consumes a `route`. When the `route` is matched, the first
`app-route` also produces `routeData` from its `data`, and `subroute` from
its `tail`. The second `app-route` consumes the `subroute`, and when it
matches, it produces an object called `subrouteData` from its `data`.

So, when `route.path` is `'/about'`, the `routeData` object will look like
this: `{ page: 'about' }`

And `subrouteData` will be null. However, if `route.path` changes to
`'/article/123'`, the `routeData` object will look like this:
`{ page: 'article' }`

And the `subrouteData` will look like this: `{ id: '123' }`

`app-route` is responsive to bi-directional changes to the `data` objects
they produce. So, if `routeData.page` changed from `'article'` to `'about'`,
the `app-route` will update `route.path`. This in-turn will update the
`app-location`, and cause the global location bar to change its value.
