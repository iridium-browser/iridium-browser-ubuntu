How to build (using gyp):

  (Note: test programs which require gtest can't build with gyp for now)

  1. If you are building OTS on Windows, download both the source
     code and compiled driver for zlib from http://www.zlib.net/
     and put them in third_party/zlib.

  2. If you are building from cloned Git repository, make sure to update the
     submodules as well:

     $ git submodule init
     $ git submodule update

  3. Run gyp_ots

    $ python gyp_ots

    This will fetch gyp and generate build files. By default, following
    files will be generated:
      - MSVS solution file on Windows
      - Xcode project file on Mac
      - Makefile on Linux

    If you want to generate Makefile on Mac, you can use -f option:

    $ python gyp_ots -f make

  4. Build OTS

    Using MSVS:
      Open ots-standalone.sln and build the solution.

    Using Xcode:
      $ xcodebuild -target ots-standalone.xcodeproj -target all

    Using Makefile:
      $ make
