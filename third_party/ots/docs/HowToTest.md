Prerequisites
=============

You can use your Ubuntu box (>= 8.04. 9.10 is recommended) to test OTS library.

First, install TrueType and OpenType fonts to the Ubuntu box as many as
possible.

    % sudo apt-get install ttf-.*[^0]$

Then, put malicious TrueType fonts on `~/malicious/`. For details, please check
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27139#c2. Currently access
to the issue is limited to chromium-security team members for security reasons.

    % cd
    % tar xjf ~/ttf-testsuite.tar.bz2

Test
====

In order to verify that:

1. OTS does not reject these unmalicious fonts.
2. and transcoded fonts OTS generates can be loaded by a system font renderer (FreeType2).

Run `test_unmalicious_fonts.sh` script:

    % cd /path/to/ots/tests
    % ./test_unmalicious_fonts.sh
    ...............................................  (verify that no FAIL: is displayed)

Then in order to verify that:

1. OTS can reject malicious fonts
2. or transcoded fonts generated by OTS do not crash a system font renderer (FreeType2).

Run `test_malicious_fonts.sh` script:

    % cd /path/to/ots/tests
    % ./test_malicious_fonts.sh
    ...............................................  (verify that no FAIL: is displayed)

Command line tools
==================

We have some command line tools for tests. To build them:

- On Linux:

        % gyp --depth=. -f make ots-standalone.gyp
        % make
        (tool is located at build/Default directory)

- On Windows (VC++ is needed):

        % gyp --depth=. -f msvs ots-standalone.gyp
        % devenv.exe /build Default ots-standalone.sln /project idempotent.vcproj
        (tool is located at Default directory)

- On Mac (XCode is needed):

        % gyp --depth=. -f xcode ots-standalone.gyp
        % xcodebuild -configuration Default -project ots-standalone.xcodeproj -target All
        (tool is located at build/Default directory)

You can use `idempotent` tool to check whether a font will be rejected or not.
You can also use `ot-sanitise` tool to get sanitised font (it is available on
Linux for now). See README file in the test directory for more details.
