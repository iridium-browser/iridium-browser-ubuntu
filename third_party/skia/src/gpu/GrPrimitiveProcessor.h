/*
 * The GrPrimitiveProcessor represents some kind of geometric primitive.  This includes the shape
 * of the primitive and the inherent color of the primitive.  The GrPrimitiveProcessor is
 * responsible for providing a color and coverage input into the Ganesh rendering pipeline.  Through
 * optimization, Ganesh may decide a different color, no color, and / or no coverage are required
 * from the GrPrimitiveProcessor, so the GrPrimitiveProcessor must be able to support this
 * functionality.  We also use the GrPrimitiveProcessor to make batching decisions.
 *
 * There are two feedback loops between the GrFragmentProcessors, the GrXferProcessor, and the
 * GrPrimitiveProcessor.  These loops run on the CPU and compute any invariant components which
 * might be useful for correctness / optimization decisions.  The GrPrimitiveProcessor seeds these
 * loops, one with initial color and one with initial coverage, in its
 * onComputeInvariantColor / Coverage calls.  These seed values are processed by the subsequent
 * stages of the rendering pipeline and the output is then fed back into the GrPrimitiveProcessor in
 * the initBatchTracker call, where the GrPrimitiveProcessor can then initialize the GrBatchTracker
 * struct with the appropriate values.
 *
 * We are evolving this system to move towards generating geometric meshes and their associated
 * vertex data after we have batched and reordered draws.  This system, known as 'deferred geometry'
 * will allow the GrPrimitiveProcessor much greater control over how data is transmitted to shaders.
 *
 * In a deferred geometry world, the GrPrimitiveProcessor can always 'batch'  To do this, each
 * primitive type is associated with one GrPrimitiveProcessor, who has complete control of how
 * it draws.  Each primitive draw will bundle all required data to perform the draw, and these
 * bundles of data will be owned by an instance of the associated GrPrimitiveProcessor.  Bundles
 * can be updated alongside the GrBatchTracker struct itself, ultimately allowing the
 * GrPrimitiveProcessor complete control of how it gets data into the fragment shader as long as
 * it emits the appropriate color, or none at all, as directed.
