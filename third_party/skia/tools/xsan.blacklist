#  This file must be a no-op C #include header, and a valid *SAN blacklist file.
#  Luckily, anything starting with # is a comment to *SAN blacklist files,
#  and anything inside #if 0 is ignored by C.  Yippee!
#
#  If you want to type '*', type '.*' instead.  Don't make C comments!

# Suppress third_party/externals.  We mostly care about our own code.
