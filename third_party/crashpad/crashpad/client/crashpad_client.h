  //! \brief Starts a Crashpad handler process, performing any necessary

  //!
  //! This method does not actually direct any crashes to the Crashpad handler,
  //! because there may be alternative ways to use an existing Crashpad handler
  //! without having to start one. To begin directing crashes to the handler,
  //! started by this method, call UseHandler() after this method returns
  //! successfully.
  //!
  //! On Mac OS X, this method starts a Crashpad handler and obtains a Mach
  //! send right corresponding to a receive right held by the handler process.
  //! The handler process runs an exception server on this port.
  //!
  //! \param[in] handler The path to a Crashpad handler executable.
  //! \param[in] database The path to a Crashpad database. The handler will be
  //!     started with this path as its `--database` argument.
  //! \param[in] url The URL of an upload server. The handler will be started
  //!     with this URL as its `--url` argument.
  //! \param[in] annotations Process annotations to set in each crash report.
  //!     The handler will be started with an `--annotation` argument for each
  //!     element in this map.
  //! \param[in] arguments Additional arguments to pass to the Crashpad handler.
  //!     Arguments passed in other parameters and arguments required to perform

  //! \brief Configures the process to direct its crashes to a Crashpad handler.
  //!
  //! The Crashpad handler must previously have been started by StartHandler().
  //!
  //! On Mac OS X, this method sets the taskâ€™s exception port for `EXC_CRASH`,
  //! `EXC_RESOURCE`, and `EXC_GUARD` exceptions to the Mach send right obtained
  //! by StartHandler(). The handler will be installed with behavior
  //! `EXCEPTION_STATE_IDENTITY | MACH_EXCEPTION_CODES` and thread state flavor
  //! `MACHINE_THREAD_STATE`. Exception ports are inherited, so a Crashpad
  //! handler chosen by UseHandler() will remain the handler for any child
  //! processes created after UseHandler() is called. Child processes do not
  //! need to call StartHandler() or UseHandler() or be aware of Crashpad in any
  //! way. The Crashpad handler will receive crashes from child processes that
  //! have inherited it as their exception handler even after the process that
  //! called StartHandler() exits.
  //!
  //! \return `true` on success, `false` on failure with a message logged.
