= Project Status

== Completed

Crashpad currently consists of a crash-reporting client and some related tools
for Mac OS X and Windows. The core client work for both platforms is
substantially complete. Crashpad became the crash reporter client for
https://dev.chromium.org/Home[Chromium] on Mac OS X as of
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/\+/d413b2dcb54d523811d386f1ff4084f677a6d089[March
2015], and on Windows as of
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/\+/cfa5b01bb1d06bf96967bd37e21a44752801948c[November
2015].

== In Progress

Initial work on a Crashpad client for
https://crashpad.chromium.org/bug/30[Android] has begun. This is currently in
the design phase.

== Future

There are plans to bring Crashpad clients to other operating systems in the
future, including a more generic non-Android Linux implementation. There are
also plans to implement a https://crashpad.chromium.org/bug/29[crash report
processor] as part of Crashpad. No timeline for completing this work has been
set yet.
