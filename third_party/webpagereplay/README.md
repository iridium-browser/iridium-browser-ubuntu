# Web Page Replay
Record live Web pages and use them for local performance testing!

## How?
Use local DNS and HTTP(S) proxies to captures your live traffic. Then
use these captures in order to replay the same exact content, making
sure that your tests get consistent results, that are not affected by
the origin servers, the network, etc.
