Description:   The Cython language makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
          easy as Python itself.  Cython is a source code translator based on the
          well-known Pyrex_, but supports more cutting edge functionality and
          optimizations.
        
          The Cython language is very close to the Python language (and most Python
          code is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally supports calling C
          functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes. This
          allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.
        
          This makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external C
          libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python
          code.
