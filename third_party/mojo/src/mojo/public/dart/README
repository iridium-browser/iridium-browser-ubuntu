These are interim instructions for building and testing Dart's Mojo bindings.
These instructions currently only work for Linux, and assume you already have a
Mojo checkout.

1.) Configure Mojo with Dart.

  $ ./mojo/tools/mojob.py gn --release --with-dart


2.) Build Mojo with Dart.

  $ ./mojo/tools/mojob.py build --release


3.) Run Dart tests.

  $ ./mojo/tools/mojob.py darttest --release
