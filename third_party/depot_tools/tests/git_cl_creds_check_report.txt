.gitcookies problem report:

  .googlesource.com record detected
    Chrome Infrastructure team recommends to list full host names explicitly.

  The following hosts were defined twice:

    dup.googlesource.com

  Credentials should come in pairs for Git and Gerrit hosts. These hosts are missing:
    partial.googlesource.com

  The following Git hosts have differing credentials from their Gerrit counterparts:

    conflict.googlesource.com git-example.google.com vs git-example.chromium.org

  These hosts likely use wrong identity:

    chrome-internal.googlesource.com git-example.chromium.org but google.com recommended
    chromium.googlesource.com        git-example.google.com but chromium.org recommended
