Description:
This contains a part of LZMA SDK 15.14.

Local Modifications:
Only the C code required to open 7z archive files and uncompress LZMA
compression has been included.

The patch in chromium.patch was applied to CpuArch.c to fix register corruption
that can occur on 64-bit platforms built with -fPIC and register clobbering that
occurred on Mac builds (but in principle can occur anywhere).
