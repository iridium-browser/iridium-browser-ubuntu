    This method resolves each given change down into a set of transactions-
    the change and its dependencies- that must go in, then tries to apply
    the largest transaction first, working its way down.

    If a transaction cannot be applied, then it is rolled back
    in full- note that if a change is involved in multiple transactions,
    if an earlier attempt fails, that change can be retried in a new
    transaction if the failure wasn't caused by the patch being incompatible
    to ToT.

    Args:
      changes: A sequence of cros_patch.GitRepoPatch instances to resolve
        and apply.
      frozen: If True, then resolving of the given changes is explicitly
        limited to just the passed in changes, or known committed changes.
        This is basically CQ/Paladin mode, used to limit the changes being
        pulled in/committed to just what we allow.
      honor_ordering: Apply normally will reorder the transactions it
        computes, trying the largest first, then degrading through smaller
        transactions if the larger of the two fails.  If honor_ordering
        is False, then the ordering given via changes is preserved-
        this is mainly of use for cbuildbot induced patching, and shouldn't
        be used for CQ patching.
      changes_filter: If not None, must be a functor taking two arguments:
        series, changes; it must return the changes to work on.
        This is invoked after the initial changes have been fetched,
        thus this is a way for consumers to do last minute checking of the
        changes being inspected, and expand the changes if necessary.
        Primarily this is of use for cbuildbot patching when dealing w/
        uploaded/remote patches.
      max_change_count: If not None, this is a soft integer limit on the number
        of patches to pull in. We stop pulling in patches as soon as we grab
        at least this many patches. Note that this limit may be exceeded by N-1,
