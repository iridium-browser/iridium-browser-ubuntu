class Operation(object):
  """Class which controls stdio and progress of an operation in progress.

  This class is created to handle stdio for a running subprocess. It filters
  it looking for errors and progress information. Optionally it can output the
  stderr and stdout to the terminal, but it is normally supressed.

  Progress information is garnered from the subprocess output based on
  knowledge of the legacy scripts, but at some point will move over to using
  real progress information reported through new python methods which will
  replace the scripts.

  Each operation has a name, and this class handles displaying this name
  as it reports progress.

  Operation Objects
  =================

  verbose: True / False
    In verbose mode all output from subprocesses is displayed, otherwise
    this output is normally supressed, unless we think it indicates an error.

  progress: True / False
    The output from subprocesses can be analysed in a very basic manner to
    try to present progress information to the user.

  explicit_verbose: True / False
    False if we are not just using default verbosity. In that case we allow
    verbosity to be enabled on request, since the user has not explicitly
    disabled it. This is used by commands that the user issues with the
    expectation that output would ordinarily be visible.
