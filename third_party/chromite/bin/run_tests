# Run chromite tests using a full virtualenv.
#
# Without arguments, runs all tests.  You can specify a specific
# moduleâ€™s tests to run:
#
# $ run_tests chromite.lib.metadata_lib_unittest
#
# This will also discover all tests under a package.  For example:
#
# $ run_tests chromite.lib.paygen
#
# This command will run all tests in the paygen package/directory.
#
# This uses the full virtualenv to allow the unittest module to
# discover tests by import path.  See the README in the chromite/venv
# directory for more information about full virtualenv.
#
# TODO(ayatane): Running all tests should be considered experimental
# for now.  It needs to be checked that the exit status properly
# reflects failures, and the UI/test output should be evaluated and
# probably cleaned up.
