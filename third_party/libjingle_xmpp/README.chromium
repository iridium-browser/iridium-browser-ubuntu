Description:
XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is a communications protocol
for messaging based on XML. xmllite is a minimalistic library for parsing and
generating XML. The source for these libraries originates from the libjingle
project, which was merged into the WebRTC codebase where it received minor
updates. As time passed, the code was no longer used in WebRTC but is still used
in Chromium. Only the parts that are used in Chromium are added here.

Local Modifications:
* Include paths in third_party/libjingle_xmpp/xmllite and
  third_party/libjingle_xmpp/xmpp are updated to reflect the new
  absolute paths to their own headers.
