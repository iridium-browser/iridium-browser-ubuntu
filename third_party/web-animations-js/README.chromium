Description:
An emulator of the Web Animations specification. Web Animations is a new
specification for animated content on the web. It's being developed as a W3C
specification as part of the CSS and SVG working groups. Latest specification at
http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/.

Used as a dependency of Polymer framework (see src/third_party/polymer). If
using directly, rather than through Polymer, use only the minified source.
Otherwise there may be CSP issues with inline scripts, etc. This should only
be updated via third_party/polymer/reproduce.sh after bumping the version number
in third_party/polymer/bower.json.

Local Modifications:
- The test and node_modules directories were removed. COPYING was renamed to LICENSE.
- Delete .travis-setup.sh because it is missing a license header. The header
  has been added upstream in
  https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-next/pull/289. Once that is
  released, .travis-setup.sh can be added back in.
