Description:
  WebDriver is a clean, fast framework for automated testing of webapps.

Contents:
  pylib/
    Python bindings and tests for WebDriver pulled in via DEPS.

  atoms.h, atoms.cc
    These atoms are generated by the webdriver team and are to be checked in
    manually. The current version was generated from revision
    21848dcbcd040417aa77c9bbfe516458331f1015.

    To generate the atoms using the code found in selenium tree:
      $ git clone https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.git
      $ cd selenium
      $ ./go //javascript/chrome-driver:atoms
      $ cp build/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.h \
           <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/atoms.h
      $ cp build/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.cc \
           <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/atoms.cc

    The atoms.h/cc files are only used directly in the chrome version of
    webdriver found under the path src/chrome/test/chromedriver.

Local Modifications:
- Applied changes in patch.diff to the selenium tree prior to building the atoms.
