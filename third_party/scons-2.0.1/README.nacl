Description:
SCons is an Open Source software construction tool-that is, a next-generation
build tool. Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the
classic Make utility with integrated functionality similar to
autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short, SCons is an
easier, more reliable and faster way to build software.

Current local modifications:

scripts/scons - exception handling for importing pkg_resources is broader.
(catch Exception vs. ImportError)  This fixes a problem encountered where the
Mac toolchain bot redefines MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.

Applied workaround from: http://scons.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2449
NOTE: Both python and SCons are NOT planning to fix this, so we will need this
fix even when upgrading to newer versions of scons or python.

Added Visual Studio 2013 support (by registry detection only) to
engine/SCons/Tools/MSCommon/vc.py
