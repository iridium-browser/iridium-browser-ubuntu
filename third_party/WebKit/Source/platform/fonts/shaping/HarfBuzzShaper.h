// Shaping text runs is split into several stages: Run segmentation, shaping the
// initial segment, identify shaped and non-shaped sequences of the shaping
// result, and processing sub-runs by trying to shape them with a fallback font
// until the last resort font is reached.
//
// If caps formatting is requested, an additional lowercase/uppercase
// segmentation stage is required. In this stage, OpenType features in the font
// are matched against the requested formatting and formatting is synthesized as
// required by the CSS Level 3 Fonts Module.
//
// Going through one example - for simplicity without caps formatting - to
// illustrate the process: The following is a run of vertical text to be
// shaped. After run segmentation in RunSegmenter it is split into 4
// segments. The segments indicated by the segementation results showing the
// script, orientation information and small caps handling of the individual
// segment. The Japanese text at the beginning has script "Hiragana", does not
// need rotation when laid out vertically and does not need uppercasing when
// small caps is requested.
//
// 0 い
// 1 ろ
// 2 は USCRIPT_HIRAGANA,
//     OrientationIterator::OrientationKeep,
//     SmallCapsIterator::SmallCapsSameCase
//
// 3 a
// 4 ̄ (Combining Macron)
// 5 a
// 6 A USCRIPT_LATIN,
//     OrientationIterator::OrientationRotateSideways,
//     SmallCapsIterator::SmallCapsUppercaseNeeded
//
// 7 い
// 8 ろ
// 9 は USCRIPT_HIRAGANA,
//      OrientationIterator::OrientationKeep,
//      SmallCapsIterator::SmallCapsSameCase
//
//
// Let's assume the CSS for this text run is as follows:
//     font-family: "Heiti SC", Tinos, sans-serif;
// where Tinos is a web font, defined as a composite font, with two sub ranges,
// one for Latin U+00-U+FF and one unrestricted unicode-range.
//
// FontFallbackIterator provides the shaper with Heiti SC, then Tinos of the
// restricted unicode-range, then the unrestricted full unicode-range Tinos, then
// a system sans-serif.
//
// The initial segment 0-2 to the shaper, together with the segmentation
// properties and the initial Heiti SC font. Characters 0-2 are shaped
// successfully with Heiti SC. The next segment, 3-5 is passed to the shaper. The
// shaper attempts to shape it with Heiti SC, which fails for the Combining
// Macron. So the shaping result for this segment would look similar to this.
//
// Glyphpos: 0 1 2 3
// Cluster:  0 0 2 3
// Glyph:    a x a A (where x is .notdef)
//
// Now in the extractShapeResults() step we notice that there is more work to do,
// since Heiti SC does not have a glyph for the Combining Macron combined with an
// a. So, this cluster together with a Todo item for switching to the next font
// is put into HolesQueue.
//
// After shaping the initial segment, the remaining items in the HolesQueue are
// processed, picking them from the head of the queue. So, first, the next font
// is requested from the FontFallbackIterator. In this case, Tinos (for the range
// U+00-U+FF) comes back. Shaping using this font, assuming it is subsetted,
// fails again since there is no combining mark available. This triggers
// requesting yet another font. This time, the Tinos font for the full
// range. With this, shaping succeeds with the following HarfBuzz result:
//
//  Glyphpos 0 1 2 3
//  Cluster: 0 0 2 3
//  Glyph:   a ̄ a A (with glyph coordinates placing the ̄ above the first a)
//
// Now this sub run is successfully processed and can be appended to
// ShapeResult. A new ShapeResult::RunInfo is created. The logic in
// insertRunIntoShapeResult then takes care of merging the shape result into
// the right position the vector of RunInfos in ShapeResult.
//
// Shaping then continues analogously for the remaining Hiragana Japanese
// sub-run, and the result is inserted into ShapeResult as well.
