// Feature Policy is a mechanism for controlling the availability of web
// platform features in a frame, including all embedded frames. It can be used
// to remove features, automatically refuse API permission requests, or modify
// the behaviour of features. (The specific changes which are made depend on the
// feature; see the specification for details).
//
// Policies can be defined in the HTTP header stream, with the |Feature-Policy|
// HTTP header, or can be set by |enable| and |disable| attributes on the iframe
// element which embeds the document.
//
// See https://wicg.github.io/FeaturePolicy/
//
// Key concepts:
//
// Features
// --------
// Features which can be controlled by policy are defined as instances of the
// FeaturePoliicy::Feature struct. The features are referenced by pointer, so
// only a single instance of each feature should be defined. The features which
// are declared in the feature policy specification are all defined in
// |FeaturePolicy.cpp|.
//
// Whitelists
// ----------
// Policies are defined as a mapping of feaure names to whitelists. Whitelists
// are collections of origins, although two special terms can be used when
// declaring them:
//   "self" refers to the orgin of the frame which is declaring the policy.
//   "*" refers to all origins; any origin will match a whitelist which contains
//     it.
//
// Declarations
// ------------
// A feature policy declaration is a mapping of a feature name to a whitelist.
// A set of declarations is a declared policy.
//
// Inherited Policy
// ----------------
// In addition to the declared policy (which may be empty), every frame has
// an inherited policy, which is determined by the context in which it is
// embedded, or by the defaults for each feature in the case of the top-level
// document.
//
// Container Policy
// ----------------
// A declared policy can be set on a specific frame by the embedding page using
// the iframe "allow" attribute, or through attributes such as "allowfullscreen"
// or "allowpaymentrequest". This is the container policy for the embedded
// frame.
//
// Defaults
// --------
// Each defined feature has a default policy, which determines whether the
// feature is available when no policy has been declared, ans determines how the
// feature is inherited across origin boundaries.
//
// If the default policy  is in effect for a frame, then it controls how the
// feature is inherited by any cross-origin iframes embedded by the frame. (See
// the comments below in FeaturePolicy::DefaultPolicy for specifics)
//
// Policy Inheritance
// ------------------
// Policies in effect for a frame are inherited by any child frames it embeds.
// Unless another policy is declared in the child, all same-origin children will
// receive the same set of enables features as the parent frame. Whether or not
// features are inherited by cross-origin iframes without an explicit policy is
// determined by the feature's default policy. (Again, see the comments in
// FeaturePolicy::DefaultPolicy for details)
