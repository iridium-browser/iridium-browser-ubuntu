# Defines properties which are available on the Settings object.
#
# Please think carefully before adding a new Setting.  Some questions to
# consider are:
# - Should this be a RuntimeEnabledFeature instead? Settings are for things
#   which we support either values of at runtime.  Features are set at renderer
#   process startup and are never changed. Features also tend to be set to a
#   value based on the platform or the stability of the code in question, where
#   as settings both codepaths need to be stable.
# - How will you ensure test coverage of all relevant values of your setting?
# - Is the default value appropriate for other platforms or ports which may
#   not be aware of your setting?
# - Can your setting result in behavior differences observable to web
#   developers?
# - Should this setting ideally be removed in the future?  If so please file
#   a bug and reference it in the comments for your setting.
#
# One reason to add a Setting is to manage the risk associated with adding a
# new feature.  For example, we may choose to ship a new UI behavior or
# performance optimization to ChromeOS users first (in order to gather feedback
# and metrics on its use from the wild) before attempting to ship it to
# Windows.
