// needs to release references to objects on the worker thread before it gets

//
// A class that inherits this interface should override
// LifecycleObserver::contextDestroyed() that is called on the main thread when
// the worker thread is about to terminate. While contextDestroyed() is called,
// it is guaranteed that the worker thread is still alive.
//
// A newly created observer should firstly check whether the worker thread is
// alive by wasContextDestroyedBeforeObserverCreation(). If this return true,
// the worker thread has already been terminated before the observer is created,
// and contextDestroyed() is never notified.
