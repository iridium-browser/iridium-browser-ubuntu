// LayoutObject is always anonymous.
//
// CounterNodes is where the logic for knowing the value of a counter is.
// LayoutCounter makes sure the CounterNodes tree is consistent with the
// style. It then just queries CounterNodes for their values.
//
// CounterNodes are rare so they are stored in a map instead of growing
// LayoutObject. counterMaps() (in LayoutCounter.cpp) keeps the association
// between LayoutObject and CounterNodes. To avoid unneeded hash-lookups in the
// common case where there is no CounterNode, LayoutObject also keeps track of
// whether it has at least one CounterNode in the hasCounterNodeMap bit.
//
// Keeping the map up to date is the reason why LayoutObjects need to call into
// LayoutCounter during their lifetime (see the static functions below).
