CONSOLE WARNING: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
This tests an isolated script's ability to XHR a blob that is in its security origin, which is not the same as the document's security origin.
We pass if there are no console errors.
