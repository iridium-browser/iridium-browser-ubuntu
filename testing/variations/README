Field Trial Testing Config
==========================

This directory contains field trial configurations that are used
to ensure testing coverage of the experiments defined in the
fieldtrial_testing_config_*.json files.

Field trial experiments specified in these configs are set to be
enabled by default for Chromium builds. This configuration is also
used for perf bots and browser tests in the waterfall.
