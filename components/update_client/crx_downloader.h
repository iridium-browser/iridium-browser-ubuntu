// fallback urls in case of errors. This class implements a chain of
// responsibility design pattern. It can give successors in the chain a chance
// to handle a download request, until one of them succeeds, or there are no
// more urls or successors to try. A callback is always called at the end of
// the download, one time only.
// When multiple urls and downloaders exists, first all the urls are tried, in
// the order they are provided in the StartDownload function argument. After
// that, the download request is routed to the next downloader in the chain.
// The members of this class expect to be called from the main thread only.
