// This class deals with page translation.
// There is one TranslateHelper per RenderView.
//
// This class provides metrics that allow tracking the user experience impact
// of non-static CldDataProvider implementations. For background on the data
// providers, please refer to the following documentation:
// http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/compact-language-detector-cld-data-source-configuration
//
// Available metrics (from the LanguageDetectionTiming enum):
// 1. ON_TIME
//    Recorded if PageCaptured(...) is invoked after CLD is available. This is
//    the ideal case, indicating that CLD is available before it is needed.
// 2. DEFERRED
//    Recorded if PageCaptured(...) is invoked before CLD is available.
//    Sub-optimal case indicating that CLD wasn't available when it was needed,
//    so the request for detection has been deferred until CLD is available or
//    until the user navigates to a different page.
// 3. RESUMED
//    Recorded if CLD becomes available after a language detection request was
//    deferred, but before the user navigated to a different page. Language
//    detection is ultimately completed, it just didn't happen on time.
//
// Note that there is NOT a metric that records the number of times that
// language detection had to be aborted because CLD never became available in
// time. This is because there is no reasonable way to cover all the cases
// under which this could occur, particularly the destruction of the renderer
// for which this object was created. However, this value can be synthetically
// derived, using the logic below.
//
// Every page load that triggers language detection will result in the
// recording of exactly one of the first two events: ON_TIME or DEFERRED. If
// CLD is available in time to satisfy the request, the third event (RESUMED)
// will be recorded; thus, the number of times when language detection
// ultimately fails because CLD isn't ever available is implied as the number of
// times that detection is deferred minus the number of times that language
// detection is late:
//
//   count(FAILED) ~= count(DEFERRED) - count(RESUMED)
//
// Note that this is not 100% accurate: some renderer process are so short-lived
// that language detection wouldn't have been relevant anyway, and so a failure
// to detect the language in a timely manner might be completely innocuous. The
// overall problem with language detection is that it isn't possible to know
// whether it was required or not until after it has been performed!
//
// We use histograms for recording these metrics. On Android, the renderer can
// be killed without the chance to clean up or transmit these histograms,
// leading to dropped metrics. To work around this, this method forces an IPC
// message to be sent to the browser process immediately.
