// A Predictor object is instantiated once in the browser process, and manages
// both preresolution of hostnames, as well as TCP/IP preconnection to expected
// subresources.
// Most hostname lists are provided by the renderer processes, and include URLs
// that *might* be used in the near future by the browsing user.  One goal of
// this class is to cause the underlying DNS structure to lookup a hostname
// before it is really needed, and hence reduce latency in the standard lookup
// paths.
// Subresource relationships are usually acquired from the referrer field in a
// navigation.  A subresource URL may be associated with a referrer URL.  Later
// navigations may, if the likelihood of needing the subresource is high enough,
// cause this module to speculatively create a TCP/IP connection. If there is
// only a low likelihood, then a DNS pre-resolution operation may be performed.
