// Utility class to record banner events for the given package or start url.
//
// These events are used to decide when banners should be shown, using a
// heuristic based on how many different days in a recent period of time (for
// example the past two weeks) the banner could have been shown, when it was
// last shown, when it was last blocked, and when it was last installed (for
// ServiceWorker style apps - native apps can query whether the app was
// installed directly).
//
// The desired effect is to have banners appear once a user has demonstrated
// an ongoing relationship with the app, and not to pester the user too much.
//
// For most events only the last event is recorded. The exception are the
// could show events. For these a list of the events is maintained. At most
// one event is stored per day, and events outside the window the heuristic
// uses are discarded. Local times are used to enforce these rules, to ensure
// what we count as a day matches what the user perceives to be days.
