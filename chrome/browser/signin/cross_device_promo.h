// The Cross Device Promo promotes Chrome Signin within a profile where there is
// one GAIA account signed in to the content area for a long period of time
// (indicating that this profile is used by only one user) and where that
// account uses Chrome Sync on other devices but is not signed in here.
//
// This class determines whether the above criteria have been met and thus
// whether the promo should be displayed. This class imposes additional criteria
// such that the promo is only displayed if there is sufficiently recent
// activity on another device, indicating the user is switching contexts but
// continuing their browsing activity. This class's behavior is controlled by
// the "CrossDevicePromo" field trial.
// The UI is defined elsewhere.
//
// This class implements the preferences necessary to track whether a profile
// meets the above criteria, and whether the user has permanently opted out of
// the promo.
//
// The class relies on the GaiaCookieManagerService to determine if there has
// been a single GAIA account signed in to the content area for a long period of
// time, and relies on the DeviceActivityFetcher to determine if that account
// uses Chrome Sync on other devices.
