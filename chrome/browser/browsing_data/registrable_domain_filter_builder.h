// A class that constructs URL deletion filters (represented as GURL->bool
// predicates) that match registerable domains - which is basically an eTLD + 1.
// This means that we ignore schemes and subdomains. This is particularly
// suitable for cookie filtering because of the cookie visibility model.
//
// Cookies are domain-scoped, and websites often rely on cookies that are living
// on various subdomains. For example, plus.google.com relies on google.com
// cookies, which eventually talks to account.google.com cookies for GAIA
// account auth. This means that when we save cookies for an origin, we need
// to save all cookies for the eTLD+1. This means blacklisting (or whitelisting)
// https://plus.google.com will have us save (or delete) any cookies for
// *.google.com (http://www.google.com, https://accounts.google.com, etc). For
// this reason we don't use origins, and instead use registerable domains.
//
// See net/base/registry_controlled_domains/registry_controlled_domain.h for
// more details on registrable domains and the current list of effective eTLDs.
//
// This filter also recognizes IP addresses and internal hostnames. Neither of
// those have subdomains (or support domain cookies), and so the filter requires
// the cookie (or other data type) source domain to be identical to the
// domain (IP address or internal hostname) for it to be considered a match.
//
// Note that e.g. "subdomain.localhost" is NOT considered to be a subdomain
// of the internal hostname "localhost". It is understood as a registrable
// domain in the scope of the TLD "localhost" (from unknown registry),
// and treated as any other registrable domain. For example,
// "www.subdomain.localhost" will be matched by a filter containing
// "subdomain.localhost". However, it is unrelated to "localhost", whose cookies
// will never be visible on "*.localhost" or vice versa.
