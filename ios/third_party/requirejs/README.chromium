Description:
RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for
in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino
and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed
and quality of your code.

Local Modifications:
Changed code for loading the modules;
Removed workarounds non needed for WebKit;
Removed code which is not used for WebUI;
