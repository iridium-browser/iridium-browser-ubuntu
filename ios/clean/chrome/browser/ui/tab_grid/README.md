# Tab Grid

-----
**The files in this directory are only used in the new architecture for iOS
Chrome**
-----

The tab grid is the grid of open tabs that is "underneath" the other views in
Chrome on iOS.

This is a **Placeholder** implementation; it presents the barest possible UI,
and in its current state is only used as part of a worked example of Chrome
architecture.
