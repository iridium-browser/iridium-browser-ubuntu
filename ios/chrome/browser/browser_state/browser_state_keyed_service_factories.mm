// This method gets the instance of each ServiceFactory. We do this so that
// each ServiceFactory initializes itself and registers its dependencies with
// the global PreferenceDependencyManager. We need to have a complete
// dependency graph when we create a browser state so we can dispatch the
// browser state creation message to the services that want to create their
// services at browser state creation time.
//
// TODO(erg): This needs to be something else. I don't think putting every
// FooServiceFactory here will scale or is desirable long term.
