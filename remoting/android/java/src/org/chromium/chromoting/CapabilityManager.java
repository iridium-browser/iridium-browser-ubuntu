/**
 * A manager for the capabilities of the Android client. Based on the negotiated set of
 * capabilities, it creates the associated ClientExtensions, and enables their communication with
 * the Chromoting host by dispatching extension messages appropriately.
 *
 * The CapabilityManager mirrors how the Chromoting host handles extension messages. For each
 * incoming extension message, runs through a list of HostExtensionSession objects, giving each one
 * a chance to handle the message.
 *
 * The CapabilityManager is a singleton class so we can manage client extensions on an application
 * level. The singleton object may be used from multiple Activities, thus allowing it to support
 * different capabilities at different stages of the application.
