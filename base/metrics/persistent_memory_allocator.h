// Simple allocator for pieces of a memory block that may be persistent
// to some storage or shared across multiple processes. This class resides
// under base/metrics because it was written for that purpose. It is,
// however, fully general-purpose and can be freely moved to base/memory
// if other uses are found.
//
// This class provides for thread-secure (i.e. safe against other threads
// or processes that may be compromised and thus have malicious intent)
// allocation of memory within a designated block and also a mechanism by
// which other threads can learn of these allocations.
//
// There is (currently) no way to release an allocated block of data because
// doing so would risk invalidating pointers held by other processes and
// greatly complicate the allocation algorithm.
//
// Construction of this object can accept new, clean (i.e. zeroed) memory
// or previously initialized memory. In the first case, construction must
// be allowed to complete before letting other allocators attach to the same
// segment. In other words, don't share the segment until at least one
// allocator has been attached to it.
//
// Note that memory not in active use is not accessed so it is possible to
// use virtual memory, including memory-mapped files, as backing storage with
// the OS "pinning" new (zeroed) physical RAM pages only as they are needed.

  // reference will not be returned twice.

  // Iteration, in general, is tolerant of corrupted memory. It will return
