// A class that provides a means to asynchronously wait for a Windows object to
// become signaled.  It is an abstraction around RegisterWaitForSingleObject
// that provides a notification callback, OnObjectSignaled, that runs back on
// the origin thread (i.e., the thread that called StartWatching).
//
// This class acts like a smart pointer such that when it goes out-of-scope,
// UnregisterWaitEx is automatically called, and any in-flight notification is
// suppressed.
//
// Typical usage:
//
//   class MyClass : public base::win::ObjectWatcher::Delegate {
//    public:
//     void DoStuffWhenSignaled(HANDLE object) {
//       watcher_.StartWatchingOnce(object, this);
//     }
//     void OnObjectSignaled(HANDLE object) override {
//       // OK, time to do stuff!
//     }
//    private:
//     base::win::ObjectWatcher watcher_;
//   };
//
// In the above example, MyClass wants to "do stuff" when object becomes
// signaled.  ObjectWatcher makes this task easy.  When MyClass goes out of
// scope, the watcher_ will be destroyed, and there is no need to worry about
// OnObjectSignaled being called on a deleted MyClass pointer.  Easy!
// If the object is already signaled before being watched, OnObjectSignaled is
// still called after (but not necessarily immediately after) watch is started.
//
// NOTE: Use of this class requires that there be a current message loop;
// otherwise, when the object is signaled, there would be no loop to post the
// callback task to.  This means that you cannot use ObjectWatcher in test code
// that doesn't create a message loop (unless you add such a loop).
