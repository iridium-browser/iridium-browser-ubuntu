/**
 * This class provides functionality to load and register the native libraries.
 * Callers are allowed to separate loading the libraries from initializing them.
 * This may be an advantage for Android Webview, where the libraries can be loaded
 * by the zygote process, but then needs per process initialization after the
 * application processes are forked from the zygote process.
 *
 * The libraries may be loaded and initialized from any thread. Synchronization
 * primitives are used to ensure that overlapping requests from different
 * threads are handled sequentially.
 *
 * See also base/android/library_loader/library_loader_hooks.cc, which contains
 * the native counterpart to this class.
